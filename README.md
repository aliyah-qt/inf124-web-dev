--GENERAL LAYOUT/DESIGN:

  INDEX.HTML: 
  Our website lands on index.html which is the home page for our store (The Unoriginal Boba Store). On this page users can read a little about the business and what we do as well as navigate to browse the menu. 

  MENU.HTML:
  The menu page is menu.html and displays the various boba products we sell. Users can click on any of these boba flavors to go to a more detailed page. 

  TEAS:
  When a boba menu item is clicked it goes to its respective html page (ex. thai.html) where the customer can read more about the product and submit an order form. The order form, when completed and if all fields are filled as desired, will prompt an email with your order summary. 

  HEADER/FOOTER:
  Every page displays a header/footer which make it easy to navigate from page to page and show information such as address/hours of operation. 

  TEAM.HTML:
  The team.html page has information about the members of the team and their background that led to the founding of the store.
